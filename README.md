# Graphql Blog on React Native

The Graphql Server used here is from [GraphQL Blog](https://github.com/gauravtiwari/relay-rails-blog) repo so, make sure to clone that repo and setup and start the rails app for GraphQL server to be available.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gauravtiwari/relay-rails-blog.git
cd relay-rails-blog
bundle install
npm install
./start (from terminal)
```


```bash
npm install
react-native run-ios --reset-cache
```

## Troubleshooting
If you see error, can't connect to development server, please hit `cmd+R` on Mac to reload the screen.
